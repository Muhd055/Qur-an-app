# Qur'an Companion App - Product Requirements Document (Social Spiritual Ecosystem)

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Qur'an Companion App
**Vision:** A "Social Spiritual Ecosystem" that transforms Qur'an engagement from a solitary activity into a consistent, gamified, and community-driven habit.
**Core Philosophy:** "Visualizing the Invisible Reward" — Digitizing the concept of *Hasanat* to provide tangible feedback for spiritual growth.

## 2. Core Philosophy & Value Proposition

### 2.1 Visualizing the Invisible Reward
The app is built on the Islamic concept of *Hasanat* (10 rewards per letter). By visualizing this in real-time, the app turns abstract spiritual promises into tangible user feedback, leveraging the psychology of habit formation (triggers, actions, variable rewards).

### 2.2 Target Audience & "Why"
- **Busy Professionals:** "I only have 5 minutes. The app tracks it for me so I feel like I accomplished something."
- **Youth:** "It looks like the apps I use every day (Instagram/Spotify). The streaks make me want to come back."
- **Struggling Readers:** "The Hasanat counter motivates me even if I struggle. I see the rewards adding up."

## 3. Comprehensive Feature Set

### 3.1 The Gamification Engine (The Hook)
- **Hasanat Counter:** A live ticker at the top of the screen that increments in real-time as the user reads (+10, +20, etc.).
- **Daily Goals:** Time-based (e.g., 10 mins) or Verse-based (e.g., 20 Ayahs) goals with visual progress rings.
- **Streaks & Consistency:** A "Streak Flame" to track consecutive days, utilizing loss aversion psychology.

### 3.2 The Social Layer (Daily Deen Feed)
- **Daily Deen Feed:** An X-style (Twitter) feed for spiritual milestones.
- **Auto-Generated Posts:** Automatic sharing of milestones (30-day streak, finishing a Juz).
- **Reflections (Tadabbur):** Users can highlight an Ayah and post a reflection to their followers.
- **Engagement:** "SubhanAllah" and "Ameen" reactions instead of standard "Likes."
- **Leaderboards:** Global and friend-based rankings.
- **Accountability Partners:** Follow friends and receive notifications when they read; "nudge" them if they miss a day.

### 3.3 The Reading Experience (The Utility)
- **Mode A: Normal Reading (Mushaf):** Standard, open-ended reading. No timers or constraints. Resumes from last page. Passive hasanat tracking.
- **Smart Interface:** Spacious, modern UI (Dark Mode default) to reduce eye strain.
- **Khatam Tracking:** Visual progress bar for the entire Qur'an with an ETA based on current reading speed.

### 3.4 "Deep Deen" Focus Mode (The Habit Builder)
- **Mode B: Focus Session:** Initiated by user choice (e.g., "Read Surah Yasin" or "15 Minutes").
- **The Lock Mechanism:** Users select "Distraction Apps" (Instagram, TikTok, etc.) to block during a session.
- **The "Egg" Gamification:** A visual egg/seed that grows/hatches as the user progresses towards the specific session goal.
- **Hasanat Engine:** Live ticker calculating **10 rewards per character** read (Character Count * 10). *Not random.*

### 3.5 Analytics & Insights
- **Weekly Reports:** Summary of minutes read and Hasanat earned.
- **Performance Graphs:** Visual charts showing reading peaks and troughs.

### 3.6 Additional Modules
- **Dhikr Module:** Daily recommended dhikr with a resettable counter and minimal analytics.
